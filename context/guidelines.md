# Design Guidelines

> Purpose:  
> These principles define the visual, structural, and experiential rules for this website.  
> They exist to keep the site consistent, credible, and maintainable when built and evolved by a single developer.

---

## 1. Clarity Over Decoration

Every element must serve a clear purpose.

- Prefer simple layouts over expressive ones
- Avoid visual noise, unnecessary ornamentation, and decorative effects
- If an element does not improve understanding, remove it

**Measure of success:**  
A visitor should understand what we do and who it is for within the first few seconds.

---

## 2. Engineering Credibility First

The site should feel precise, calm, and trustworthy.

- Use restrained color and motion
- Favor structure, alignment, and hierarchy over visual novelty
- Avoid playful or trendy aesthetics that undermine seriousness

**Rule:**  
If a design choice feels “cool” but not “confident,” it is likely wrong.

---

## 3. Consistency Through Constraints

Consistency is achieved through rules, not tooling.

- Use predefined spacing, typography steps, and color tokens only
- Avoid one-off sizes, colors, or alignments
- Reuse layout patterns and page templates

**Rule:**  
If a value is not defined as a variable, it should not be used.

---

## 4. Content-Driven Design

Layout exists to support content, not the other way around.

- Design around real copy and real data
- Prioritize readability and scanning
- Let content define component size and spacing

**Rule:**  
Never design with placeholder content in production.

---

## 5. Hierarchy Is Non-Negotiable

Visual hierarchy guides understanding.

- One primary message per section
- Clear distinction between headings, body text, and metadata
- Avoid competing focal points within the same viewport

**Measure of success:**  
A user should be able to skim the page and understand its structure without reading everything.

---

## 6. Fewer Components, Stronger Patterns

Reusable patterns matter more than reusable components.

- Create components only when they repeat meaningfully
- Prefer layout primitives over complex UI abstractions
- Pages may contain unique compositions without becoming components

**Rule:**  
A component must justify its existence by reuse.

---

## 7. Predictable Layout Rhythm

Pages should feel calm and intentional.

- Use consistent vertical spacing between sections
- Align content to a common grid
- Avoid sudden changes in density or scale

**Rule:**  
Spacing communicates importance as much as typography.

---

## 8. Subtle Motion, If Any

Motion should support understanding, not attract attention.

- Use motion sparingly and purposefully
- Favor opacity and transform-based transitions
- Avoid continuous, looping, or decorative animations

**Rule:**  
If motion is noticeable, it is probably too strong.

---

## 9. Accessibility Is Baseline Quality

Accessibility is not a feature — it is a minimum standard.

- Use semantic structure and clear labeling
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Maintain visible focus states for all interactive elements

**Rule:**  
If an interaction is unclear without a mouse, it is broken.

---

## 10. Performance Is Part of Design

Speed affects perception of quality and trust.

- Prefer simple layouts and lightweight assets
- Avoid unnecessary visual effects that impact load or interaction
- Design for fast initial rendering

**Rule:**  
A fast, simple page is better than a slow, impressive one.

---

## 11. Case Studies Are the Primary Proof

Case studies are the most important content on the site.

- Structure them clearly and consistently
- Focus on problems, constraints, decisions, and outcomes
- Avoid marketing language in favor of technical clarity

**Rule:**  
If a page does not increase credibility, it does not belong.

---

## 12. Design for Longevity

The site should age well.

- Avoid short-lived trends
- Favor neutral, timeless visual decisions
- Make changes intentionally and infrequently

**Measure of success:**  
The site should still feel appropriate and professional years from now.

---

## Summary

This site values:
- Clarity over cleverness
- Structure over decoration
- Restraint over expression
- Content over components
- Longevity over trends

When in doubt, remove, simplify, and clarify.
